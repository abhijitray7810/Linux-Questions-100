# File Permissions
## Q16. Explain Linux file permissions and how to read them.
- Permissions are shown as r (read), w (write), x (execute) for user, group, and others. Example: -rw-r--r-- means file with read-write for owner, read for group and others. Directory permissions include execute for traversal.
- r= (1)
- w= (2)
- x= (4)
- (-)= (0)
- (d)= Directory
- (-)= file
- drwxrwxrwx= 777 (r+w+x)= 7(1+2+4), (r+w+x)= 7(1+2+4), (r+w+x)= 7(1+2+4)
